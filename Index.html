		Hello, and welcome to my shitty site that is a very very seriously work in progress, because holy fuck is this a trash site rn.
		Anyways, this is a site dedicated to me and some things that I do. 
		I have this page, which is the home page. It's to greet people and show my best of stuffs, because then I look better cuz if I show everything else you wouldn't be on here for more than 3 seconds.
		I have the channel page which sends you on over to my Youtube channel so you can check that out. Rn it's just the one channel which is my minecraft channel, and eventually it will show off links to various things of me like my mixer and another channel I will make dedicated to any game I play that isn't minecraft/ just highlights from my streams once I get the time to be able to do that.
		The next page is Minecraft and it shows off some of my builds I've done in Bedrock edition and will eventually be for a how to redstone page for Bedrock that will explain and help new comers to the redstone in Bedrock or in general how to go about using it and making wonderful creations with it like I have.
		The last page is the About page and will show off my socials, like my Youtube, Mixer, Twitter, and a way to communicate with me directly from this site so you can make sure any questions you have about me, my site, or even redstone or gaming can be answered. Please no super personal questions and also if I don't respond I'm either busy for the moment and haven't been able to check anything, or I'm in Air Force BMT at the moment. Hope you enjoy the site and all it's terribly made glory! :)
